Notes created by Html

This Google Notes clone is an HTML-based website that allows users to create, view, edit, and delete notes. The website's structure consists 
of a header section containing the website's name, a main section displaying the user's notes or a create note form.

The create note form allows users to apply formatting styles such as bold, italic, and underline. Once created, notes are saved and displayed on the user's list of existing notes, which can be viewed or edited by clicking the "View Notes" or "Edit" buttons, respectively.

One of the advantages of using HTML to build this website is that it is lightweight and fast. Since there is no backend or database involved,
the website loads quickly and is easy to maintain. However, one of the limitations of using HTML is that it does not provide dynamic 
functionality. This means that users cannot perform certain actions such as searching for specific notes or sorting them based on date or 
category.

In terms of design, this website is simple and minimalist. It has been designed to be responsive, which means it can adjust its layout based
on the screen size of the device being used. This makes it easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.

Another notable feature of Google Notes is its ability to sync notes across multiple devices. However, since this clone does not have a 
backend or database, this feature is not included. Users can only access their notes on the device they created them on.
